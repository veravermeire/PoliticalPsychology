# Political Polarization: Agent-Based Simulation

## Project Overview

This project uses an agent-based simulation in R to investigate how three psychological and environmental factors influence political polarization:

- **Identity strength:** How strongly individuals identify with their political group.
- **Perceived polarization:** How polarized individuals believe their environment is.
- **Congenial media:** Exposure to media aligned with one's political group.

The simulation examines how these factors influence opinion differences between two political groups over time.

## Methodology

We conducted a **2 × 2 × 2 factorial experiment**, testing each parameter at low (0.2) and high (0.8) levels. Each of the eight conditions was simulated 30 times, with 100 agents and 200 simulation steps per run.

We measured polarization as the difference between the groups' average opinions and used repeated-measures factorial ANOVA to compare conditions.

## Key Findings

1. **Identity × media interaction:** Stronger identity increased depolarization under low congenial media exposure but reduced depolarization under high exposure.
2. **Perceived polarization:** Higher perceived polarization slowed early depolarization and delayed stabilization but had little influence on final polarization.
3. **Robustness:** The main findings remained consistent when network density was increased. The stabilization effect also persisted across different tolerance thresholds.

## Limitations

These findings describe the behavior of a computational model under specific assumptions and do not establish causal relationships in real-world populations.
